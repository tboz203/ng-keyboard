ok, from the top. went through and renamed everything in the project from 'pad'
to 'board', like keypad and padID, etc. something somwhere broke, branched and
rolled back to original. started at a different place, in the partial. changed
from just digits to entire keyboard. characters go in fine, still working on
meta key functionality. re-worked the CSS such that it looks like a keyboard,
which is nice.

figured out what was wrong with the meta keys: it couldn't resolve 'controller'
inside the demo code. moved it all over to src/ngKeypad/ngKeypadInput.js and it
works like a charm.
